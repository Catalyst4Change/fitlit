# FitLit

## Introduction
-  This project was a group assignment for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 2. We created a fitness tracker site called FitLit where a user can track all of their activities in once place.  A user is able to see their daily step goals in comparison to other users.  They are also able to track sleep habits and water intake in one convenient place.

## Technologies

## Challenges

- Navigating the class to class interations once classes and tests were written.
